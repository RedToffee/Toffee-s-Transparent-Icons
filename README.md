# Toffee's Transparent Icons

I used the background of the Arc Browser logo and made versions of all the apps I use with transparent backgrounds! (And some I don't use. Believe it or not I do not frequently use 10 web browsers.)

Happy customization!

If you want to know how to use the System Icons you can check out [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/1fxwjqm/comment/lqth87n/?context=3) :)
## Feedback

If you have a suggestion, request, or find a problem, feel free to reach out or make an issue if that's how github works. But keep in mind, I know they're not pixel perfect. Just don't look at them that close hahaha...

## Acknowledgements

I modified the Arc Browser icon getting rid of their logo to make these. *Hopefully* that was legal. Uh these are all **parodies** just so you know government.

I also used the original icons for a majority of these icons in order to make the new versions with a couple exceptions
