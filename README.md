I used the background of the Arc Browser logo and made versions of all the apps I use with transparent backgrounds!
(And some I don't use. Believe it or not I do not frequently use 10 web browsers.)
If you have a suggestion, want me to make some icon, or find something wrong with one of the icons, feel free to reach out or make an issue however github works.
Happy customization!
